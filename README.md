NEW VERSION 1.3.3 UPLOADED 

AstroExecutor is a free-to-download unrivaled Roblox script executor that allows players to run scripts in their favorite Roblox games. This software is available on PC (Windows 11/10/8.1/7) and Android mobile devices. Itâ€™s mainly used to run custom-created code called scripts into the Roblox game client.

Using it can help you increase your movement speed in-game, automate certain tasks, get abilities like aimbot, etc. It is user-friendly and easy to use, especially for those who are new to scripting in Roblox or scripting in general.

Alternatives like JJSploit and Kiwi X can perform the same functions and sometimes even add newer ones. You can also try them out if you wish to experiment with different apps.
